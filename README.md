# Computer Vision

-------------------- HOLD for the following planning for future ------------------------

### Planning
* [Computer Vision Tutorial for Beginners | Learn Computer Vision](https://www.projectpro.io/data-science-in-python-tutorial/computer-vision-tutorial-for-beginners#mcetoc_1fcvfccbed):  Oct22 - Oct29

### Summary
* there are 2 type of image: 2D / 3D (add depth information)
* there are few topis for CV: 
   * Object detection: accuracy / recall, model compression
   * Image Classification: in current stage, for selfdriving speed is the pain point
   * object tracking: motion estimation

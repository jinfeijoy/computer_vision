# Computer Vision


In the early stage, it called digital image processing, just recently, with powerful computer and ML/DL, it become CV. Previously the most important part for digital image processing is kernal, people need to manually adjust kernal to process image. Currently the computer can train model to calculate millions of kernals and do model selection for different scenarios. For example, for different image problems, e.g. image classification, can be done with different small projects with kernal trained. With more data and more scenarios, the model will be more accurate.

### Summary
* there are 2 type of image: 2D / 3D (add depth information)
* there are few topis for CV: 
   * Object detection: accuracy / recall, model compression
   * Image Classification: in current stage, for selfdriving speed is the pain point
   * object tracking: motion estimation
* Basic Processor: Machine learning algorithms such as k-NN, SVMs, and even Convolutional Neural Networks require all images in a dataset to have a fixed feature vector size. In the case of images, this requirement implies that our images must be preprocessed and scaled to have identical widths and heights.
* KNN: fluffiness and lightness ??
